# Cinema-Audience-Forecasting-Machine-Learning-Project
#Project_Overview This project aims to forecast daily cinema audience attendance using historical data from online bookings and on-site ticket sales. By capturing time-series patterns, booking behavior, and calendar effects (weekends and holidays), the model predicts future audience demand for individual theatres.
